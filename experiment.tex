\chapter[]{Anomaly Detection Using Recurrent Neural Networks}


Chapters \ref{ch:ad} and \ref{ch:rnn}, separately, introduced anomaly detection in time series and recurrent neural networks as time series modelers. Now RNNs 

in ch ad we talked about. in ch rnn we talked about

for detailed overall trning: 'How large should the batch size be for stochastic gradient descent?'


'advances in optimizing recurrent nn' enhanced sgd still competitive or better
'Equilibrated adaptive learning rates for non-convex optimization' -rmsprop is good. sgd good but issue is just how to adjust weights.
