I would like to primarily thank John Kaufhold for being responsive to my questions regaurding everything related to neural networks. I also would like to acknowledge Ted Dunning for his insights on anomaly detection. Also, Pankaj Malhotra whose work is simialar to this answered questions. theanets guy

This research approaches the problem of finding anomalies in time series by using more general and robust modeling provided by recent advances in recurrent neural networks (RNNs). The information from RNNs is used in an anomaly detection technique (tbd).
